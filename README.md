# Engy

Hi, I really haven't developed much into engy, but I hope to make it a great and easy to use library for hive-engine. I've had to work a lot with it recently and to make my life easier, I started writing this. If you'd like to contribute, just make a PR, and I'll most likely accept it. 

### Installation

With NPM:
`npm i https://github.com/Rishi556/engy`

With Yarn
`yarn add https://github.com/Rishi556/engy`

I haven't published it yet as I'd like there to be some good features before publishing. If you get it from npm, you'll get the old version which works with Steem.
